rm exam_platform.db
python app.py
```

### Import Errors

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### AI Enhancement Not Working

- Check that ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in .env
- Verify API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Review console logs for errors

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For production use:

1. **Change SECRET_KEY** to a strong random value
2. **Use production WSGI server** (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
3. **Use production database** (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
4. **Enable HTTPS**
5. **Set debug=False** in app.py
6. **Configure proper logging**
7. **Implement rate limiting**
8. **Add user email verification**
9. **Implement password reset**
10. **Add CSRF protection** (already included in Flask-WTF)
